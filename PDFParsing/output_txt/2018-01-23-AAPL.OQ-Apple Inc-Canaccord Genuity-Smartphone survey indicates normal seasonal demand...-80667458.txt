Raising Target Price

Smartphone survey indicates normal seasonal
demand; adjusting iPhone estimates
Investment recommendation: While our US survey work indicated strong iPhone sales
during the December quarter, sales appear more consistent with normal seasonal
trends during January. Further, with iPhone X reaching supply demand balance exiting
the December quarter or ahead of our expectations, we are increasing our December
quarter estimates but lowering our March quarter iPhone estimates. We are modeling
the global iPhone replacement rate will increase to 31.3% in C2018 from 26.8% in
C2017, as the new iPhone features and improving supply drive a stronger upgrade
cycle from Apple’s growing installed base. Following our expectations that strong
C2018 upgrade sales will help generate 241M in iPhone sales, we anticipate a slightly
moderating but still strong upgrade rate of 29.0% in C2019 to generate 239M iPhone
sales. We believe Apple continues to grow its leading market share of the premium-tier
smartphone market and believe the iPhone installed base will exceed 635M exiting
C2017. This impressive installed base should drive strong iPhone replacement sales and
earnings, as well as cash flow generation to fund strong long-term capital returns. We
reiterate our BUY rating and increase our price target to $200.
Anticipate more normal seasonal iPhone sales, resulting in lowered F2018 iPhone
estimates but increased F2019 estimates: Our survey work indicates iPhone X sales
were strong during the December quarter, but sales appear slower in January, more in
line with normal seasonal trends. We had anticipated iPhone X supply would not meet
demand until well into the March quarter, leading to our expectations for a stronger
than normal March quarter. Given supply met demand exiting the December quarter
combined with a more normal seasonal demand start to C2018, we have increased our
Q1/F2018 or December quarter iPhone estimates from 78.5M units to 80.6M units but
lowered our Q2/F18 iPhone estimates from 66.0M units to 59.9M units. For F2018,
we have lowered our iPhone unit assumptions from 249M to 241M units, but we have
increased our F2019 iPhone unit estimates from 235M units to 239M units. With the
HomePod anticipated to launch in February, we have also increased our other products
revenue estimates. These changes led to our Apple C2017/C2018/C2019 EPS estimate
changes from $9.56/$12.37/$12.24 to $9.70/$11.95/$12.51.
Increased mix of larger screen OLED iPhones likely to drive strong ongoing iPhone
sales through C2019: We anticipate new OLED screen iPhones will launch in September
2018 to help drive a continued strong upgrade cycle to higher margin and higher ASP
iPhones. With our belief Apple will launch an iPhone X plus type combined with new
improved features for the current sized iPhone X product, we believe Apple’s iPhone
franchise will extend strong sales of higher-priced iPhones through C2019. Despite our
lowered near-term estimates, we believe our C2019 estimates could prove conservative
as new iPhones could drive a stronger replacement cycle than the initial iPhone X
versus our current estimates anticipating a modest slowdown in 2019 upgrade sales.
Further, with Apple’s cash repatriation, increased capital returns and especially stock
repurchases could also create upside to our estimates. Therefore, we reiterate our BUY
rating and increase our price target to $200.

Raising Target Price

Surveys indicate normal seasonal iPhone sales trends 

Our survey work indicates iPhone X sales were strong during the December quarter 
but sales appear slower in January, more in line with normal seasonal trends. We had 
anticipated iPhone X supply would not meet demand until well into the March quarter, 
leading to our expectations for a stronger than normal March quarter. Given supply 
met demand exiting the December quarter combined with a more normal seasonal 
demand start to C2018, we have increased our Q1/F2018 or December quarter 
iPhone estimates from 78.5M units to 80.6M units but lowered our Q2/F18 iPhone 
estimates from 66.0M units to 59.9M units. For F2018, we have lowered our iPhone 
unit assumptions from 249M to 241M units, but we have increased our F2019 
iPhone unit estimates from 235M units to 239M units. Despite our lower near-term 
iPhone estimates, we believe new OLED screen iPhones launching in September 
2018 will drive continued strong iPhone sales through C2019.    

Large installed iPhone base positions Apple for a strong upgrade cycle through 
C2019 

Figure 1 on page 3 provides detailed analysis of the installed iPhone base, annual 
iPhone net additions, replacement iPhone sales, and replacement rates by regions of 
the world. We estimate our 635M iPhone installed base exiting C2017 represents only 
40% of the 1.6B global premium market smartphone subscribers estimated by the 
end of C2017, according to Gartner. Based on our potentially conservative 
replacement rate and installed base growth assumptions, we estimate Apple could 
sell roughly 225M to 275M iPhone units annually based on its growing and loyal 
installed base of new iPhone consumers.  

We believe there is a large group of iPhone 6 or older iPhone users positioned to 
upgrade to the new iPhone products, and therefore we are modeling the percent of 
iPhone users to upgrade to a new iPhone to increase to 31.3% in C2018 from roughly 
26.8% in C2017. We note our C2018 replacement sale estimate was lowered from 
32.4% given our expectations for a more seasonally normal start to C2018 versus our 
previous expectations for a very strong March quarter. We believe the 31.3% upgrade 
rate for C2018 is still consistent with the strong upgrade rate in C2014 and C2015 
driven by the iPhone 6 upgrade cycle. While we anticipate product introductions could 
generate stronger sales in one year versus another, we believe Apple’s growing share 
of the high-end smartphone market positions Apple with a strong, loyal customer base 
that could enable Apple to maintain the high-levels of sales generated during C2015 
with the successful iPhone 6 launch despite the higher ASPs for the iPhone 8 and X 
products versus the 6 products. In fact, given the growing installed base, we believe 
Apple will sell more iPhones in C2018 and C2019 with our 241M and 239M 
estimates, respectively versus the 232M units sold in C2015. With these levels of 
annual iPhone sales generating strong sales levels and margins, we believe this 
should drive very strong long-term sales, earnings, and cash flow generation for Apple 
to sustain or even increase its capital returns program, especially with the anticipated 
repatriation up to $250M. Given our expectations for a strong upgrade cycle 
combined with new product introductions potentially contributing upside to our C2019 
estimates, we reiterate our BUY rating and increase our price target to $200.

Investment Recommendation
Date and time of first dissemination: January 23, 2018, 23:11 ET
Date and time of production: January 23, 2018, 17:20 ET
Target Price / Valuation Methodology:
Apple - AAPL
Our $200 price target is based on shares trading at roughly 16x our C2019 EPS estimate.
Risks to achieving Target Price / Valuation:
Apple - AAPL
Risks to our investment thesis include: 1. Gross margin for key products such as the iPhone decline below our expectations. 2. Ability
to innovate slows or competition catches up versus Apple's next iteration of its products. 3. Macro uncertainty leads to slower than
expected sales of Apple products.

Some regulators require that a firm must establish, implement and make available a policy for managing conflicts of interest arising as
a result of publication or distribution of research. This research has been prepared in accordance with Canaccord Genuity’s policy on
managing conflicts of interest, and information barriers or firewalls have been used where appropriate. Canaccord Genuity’s policy is
available upon request.
The information contained in this research has been compiled by Canaccord Genuity from sources believed to be reliable, but (with the
exception of the information about Canaccord Genuity) no representation or warranty, express or implied, is made by Canaccord Genuity,
its affiliated companies or any other person as to its fairness, accuracy, completeness or correctness. Canaccord Genuity has not
independently verified the facts, assumptions, and estimates contained herein. All estimates, opinions and other information contained
in this research constitute Canaccord Genuity’s judgement as of the date of this research, are subject to change without notice and are
provided in good faith but without legal responsibility or liability.
From time to time, Canaccord Genuity salespeople, traders, and other professionals provide oral or written market commentary or
trading strategies to our clients and our principal trading desk that reflect opinions that are contrary to the opinions expressed in this
research. Canaccord Genuity’s affiliates, principal trading desk, and investing businesses also from time to time make investment
decisions that are inconsistent with the recommendations or views expressed in this research.
This research is provided for information purposes only and does not constitute an offer or solicitation to buy or sell any designated
investments discussed herein in any jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would be prohibited. As a result, the designated
investments discussed in this research may not be eligible for sale in some jurisdictions. This research is not, and under no
circumstances should be construed as, a solicitation to act as a securities broker or dealer in any jurisdiction by any person or company
that is not legally permitted to carry on the business of a securities broker or dealer in that jurisdiction. This material is prepared for
general circulation to clients and does not have regard to the investment objectives, financial situation or particular needs of any
particular person. Investors should obtain advice based on their own individual circumstances before making an investment decision.
To the fullest extent permitted by law, none of Canaccord Genuity, its affiliated companies or any other person accepts any liability
whatsoever for any direct or consequential loss arising from or relating to any use of the information contained in this research.

sales and trading personnel via email, instant message or other electronic means. Customers entitled to receive research may also
receive it via third party vendors. Until such time as research is made available to Canaccord Genuity’s customers as described above,
Authoring Analysts will not discuss the contents of their research with Sales and Trading or Investment Banking employees without prior
compliance consent.
For further information about the proprietary model(s) associated with the covered issuer(s) in this research report, clients should
contact their local sales representative.
Short-Term Trade Ideas
Research Analysts may, from time to time, discuss “short-term trade ideas” in research reports. A short-term trade idea offers a near-
term view on how a security may trade, based on market and trading events or catalysts, and the resulting trading opportunity that may
be available. Any such trading strategies are distinct from and do not affect the analysts' fundamental equity rating for such stocks. A
short-term trade idea may differ from the price targets and recommendations in our published research reports that reflect the research
analyst's views of the longer-term (i.e. one-year or greater) prospects of the subject company, as a result of the differing time horizons,
methodologies and/or other factors. It is possible, for example, that a subject company's common equity that is considered a long-
term ‘Hold' or 'Sell' might present a short-term buying opportunity as a result of temporary selling pressure in the market or for other
reasons described in the research report; conversely, a subject company's stock rated a long-term 'Buy' or “Speculative Buy’ could be
considered susceptible to a downward price correction, or other factors may exist that lead the research analyst to suggest a sale over
the short-term. Short-term trade ideas are not ratings, nor are they part of any ratings system, and the firm does not intend, and does not
undertake any obligation, to maintain or update short-term trade ideas. Short-term trade ideas are not suitable for all investors and are
not tailored to individual investor circumstances and objectives, and investors should make their own independent decisions regarding
any securities or strategies discussed herein. Please contact your salesperson for more information regarding Canaccord Genuity’s
research.
