Raising Target Price
Smartphone survey indicates normal seasonal
demand adjusting iPhone estimates
Investment recommendation While our US survey work indicated strong iPhone sales
during the December quarter sales appear more consistent with normal seasonal
trends during January Further with iPhone X reaching supply demand balance exiting
the December quarter or ahead of our expectations we are increasing our December
quarter estimates but lowering our March quarter iPhone estimates We are modeling
the global iPhone replacement rate will increase to  in C from  in
C as the new iPhone features and improving supply drive a stronger upgrade
cycle from Apples growing installed base Following our expectations that strong
C upgrade sales will help generate M in iPhone sales we anticipate a slightly
moderating but still strong upgrade rate of  in C to generate M iPhone
sales We believe Apple continues to grow its leading market share of the premiumtier
smartphone market and believe the iPhone installed base will exceed M exiting
C This impressive installed base should drive strong iPhone replacement sales and
earnings as well as cash flow generation to fund strong longterm capital returns We
reiterate our BUY rating and increase our price target to
Anticipate more normal seasonal iPhone sales resulting in lowered F iPhone
estimates but increased F estimates Our survey work indicates iPhone X sales
were strong during the December quarter but sales appear slower in January more in
line with normal seasonal trends We had anticipated iPhone X supply would not meet
demand until well into the March quarter leading to our expectations for a stronger
than normal March quarter Given supply met demand exiting the December quarter
combined with a more normal seasonal demand start to C we have increased our
QF or December quarter iPhone estimates from M units to M units but
lowered our QF iPhone estimates from M units to M units For F
we have lowered our iPhone unit assumptions from M to M units but we have
increased our F iPhone unit estimates from M units to M units With the
HomePod anticipated to launch in February we have also increased our other products
revenue estimates These changes led to our Apple CCC EPS estimate
changes from  to
Increased mix of larger screen OLED iPhones likely to drive strong ongoing iPhone
sales through C We anticipate new OLED screen iPhones will launch in September
 to help drive a continued strong upgrade cycle to higher margin and higher ASP
iPhones With our belief Apple will launch an iPhone X plus type combined with new
improved features for the current sized iPhone X product we believe Apples iPhone
franchise will extend strong sales of higherpriced iPhones through C Despite our
lowered nearterm estimates we believe our C estimates could prove conservative
as new iPhones could drive a stronger replacement cycle than the initial iPhone X
versus our current estimates anticipating a modest slowdown in  upgrade sales
Further with Apples cash repatriation increased capital returns and especially stock
repurchases could also create upside to our estimates Therefore we reiterate our BUY
rating and increase our price target to

Raising Target Price
Surveys indicate normal seasonal iPhone sales trends
Our survey work indicates iPhone X sales were strong during the December quarter
but sales appear slower in January more in line with normal seasonal trends We had
anticipated iPhone X supply would not meet demand until well into the March quarter
leading to our expectations for a stronger than normal March quarter Given supply
met demand exiting the December quarter combined with a more normal seasonal
demand start to C we have increased our QF or December quarter
iPhone estimates from M units to M units but lowered our QF iPhone
estimates from M units to M units For F we have lowered our iPhone
unit assumptions from M to M units but we have increased our F
iPhone unit estimates from M units to M units Despite our lower nearterm
iPhone estimates we believe new OLED screen iPhones launching in September
 will drive continued strong iPhone sales through C
Large installed iPhone base positions Apple for a strong upgrade cycle through
Figure  on page  provides detailed analysis of the installed iPhone base annual
iPhone net additions replacement iPhone sales and replacement rates by regions of
the world We estimate our M iPhone installed base exiting C represents only
 of the B global premium market smartphone subscribers estimated by the
end of C according to Gartner Based on our potentially conservative
replacement rate and installed base growth assumptions we estimate Apple could
sell roughly M to M iPhone units annually based on its growing and loyal
installed base of new iPhone consumers
We believe there is a large group of iPhone  or older iPhone users positioned to
upgrade to the new iPhone products and therefore we are modeling the percent of
iPhone users to upgrade to a new iPhone to increase to  in C from roughly
 in C We note our C replacement sale estimate was lowered from
 given our expectations for a more seasonally normal start to C versus our
previous expectations for a very strong March quarter We believe the  upgrade
rate for C is still consistent with the strong upgrade rate in C and C
driven by the iPhone  upgrade cycle While we anticipate product introductions could
generate stronger sales in one year versus another we believe Apples growing share
of the highend smartphone market positions Apple with a strong loyal customer base
that could enable Apple to maintain the highlevels of sales generated during C
with the successful iPhone  launch despite the higher ASPs for the iPhone  and X
products versus the  products In fact given the growing installed base we believe
Apple will sell more iPhones in C and C with our M and M
estimates respectively versus the M units sold in C With these levels of
annual iPhone sales generating strong sales levels and margins we believe this
should drive very strong longterm sales earnings and cash flow generation for Apple
to sustain or even increase its capital returns program especially with the anticipated
repatriation up to M Given our expectations for a strong upgrade cycle
combined with new product introductions potentially contributing upside to our C
estimates we reiterate our BUY rating and increase our price target to

ShortTerm Trade Ideas
Research Analysts may from time to time discuss shortterm trade ideas in research reports A shortterm trade idea offers a near

be available Any such trading strategies are distinct from and do not affect the analysts fundamental equity rating for such stocks A
shortterm trade idea may differ from the price targets and recommendations in our published research reports that reflect the research
analysts views of the longerterm ie oneyear or greater prospects of the subject company as a result of the differing time horizons
methodologies andor other factors It is possible for example that a subject companys common equity that is considered a long
term Hold or Sell might present a shortterm buying opportunity as a result of temporary selling pressure in the market or for other
reasons described in the research report conversely a subject companys stock rated a longterm Buy or Speculative Buy could be
considered susceptible to a downward price correction or other factors may exist that lead the research analyst to suggest a sale over
the shortterm Shortterm trade ideas are not ratings nor are they part of any ratings system and the firm does not intend and does not
undertake any obligation to maintain or update shortterm trade ideas Shortterm trade ideas are not suitable for all investors and are
not tailored to individual investor circumstances and objectives and investors should make their own independent decisions regarding
