during the December quarter sales appear more consistent with normal seasonal
trends during January Further with iPhone reaching supply demand balance exiting
the December quarter or ahead of our expectations we are increasing our December
quarter estimates but lowering our March quarter iPhone estimates We are modeling
the global iPhone replacement rate will increase to  in  from  in

cycle from Apple’s growing installed base Following our expectations that strong
 upgrade sales will help generate  in iPhone sales we anticipate slightly
moderating but still strong upgrade rate of  in  to generate  iPhone
sales We believe Apple continues to grow its leading market share of the premium-tier
smartphone market and believe the iPhone installed base will exceed  exiting

Raising Target Price
Surveys indicate normal seasonal iPhone sales trends
Our survey work indicates iPhone sales were strong during the December quarter
but sales appear slower in January more in line with normal seasonal trends We had
anticipated iPhone supply would not meet demand until well into the March quarter
leading to our expectations for stronger than normal March quarter Given supply
met demand exiting the December quarter combined with more normal seasonal
demand start to  we have increased our  or December quarter
iPhone estimates from  units to  units but lowered our  iPhone
estimates from  units to  units For  we have lowered our iPhone
unit assumptions from  to  units but we have increased our
iPhone unit estimates from  units to  units Despite our lower near-term
iPhone estimates we believe new OLED screen iPhones launching in September
 will drive continued strong iPhone sales through
Large installed iPhone base positions Apple for strong upgrade cycle through
Figure  on page  provides detailed analysis of the installed iPhone base annual
iPhone net additions replacement iPhone sales and replacement rates by regions of
the world We estimate our  iPhone installed base exiting  represents only
 of the  global premium market smartphone subscribers estimated by the
end of  according to Gartner Based on our potentially conservative
replacement rate and installed base growth assumptions we estimate Apple could
sell roughly  to  iPhone units annually based on its growing and loyal
installed base of new iPhone consumers
We believe there is large group of iPhone  or older iPhone users positioned to
upgrade to the new iPhone products and therefore we are modeling the percent of
iPhone users to upgrade to new iPhone to increase to  in  from roughly
 in  We note our  replacement sale estimate was lowered from
 given our expectations for more seasonally normal start to  versus our
previous expectations for very strong March quarter We believe the  upgrade
rate for  is still consistent with the strong upgrade rate in  and
driven by the iPhone  upgrade cycle While we anticipate product introductions could
generate stronger sales in one year versus another we believe Apple’s growing share
of the high-end smartphone market positions Apple with strong loyal customer base
that could enable Apple to maintain the high-levels of sales generated during
with the successful iPhone  launch despite the higher ASPs for the iPhone  and
products versus the  products In fact given the growing installed base we believe
Apple will sell more iPhones in  and  with our  and
estimates respectively versus the  units sold in  With these levels of
annual iPhone sales generating strong sales levels and margins we believe this
should drive very strong long-term sales earnings and cash flow generation for Apple
to sustain or even increase its capital returns program especially with the anticipated
repatriation up to  Given our expectations for strong upgrade cycle
combined with new product introductions potentially contributing upside to our
estimates we reiterate our BUY rating and increase our price target to
