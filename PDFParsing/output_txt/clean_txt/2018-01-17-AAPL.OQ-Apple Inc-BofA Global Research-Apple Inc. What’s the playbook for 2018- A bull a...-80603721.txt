Company Description
Apple Inc AAPL  designs  manufactures  and
markets consumer electronics and computers  and
has developed its own proprietary iOS and Mac OS
 operating systems and related software
platform ecosystem  Revenues are principally
derived from the iPhone line of smartphones
hardware sales of the Macintosh family of
notebook and desktop computers  iPad tablets  and
iPod portable digital music players  The company
also realizes revenue from software  peripherals
digital media  and services
Investment Rationale
We rate Apple Buy on potential upside from
Continued long-term opportunity in China
potential share gains from the release of lower-
end iPhone strength of the iPhone  cycle
optionality in cash balance  revenue sources like
Apple Pay  Apple Watch  home health kit  etc that

 The playbook for

buybacks or dividend increases smoother iPhone cycle with two years of unit and

pricing provide tailwinds Continued strong growth in Services larger OLED
phone in  with rear  sensing that broadens the product line further An
increased adoption of AR VR driving Apples lead further  and  Introduction of

Bull case explored further
Cash repatriation potential
Apple has  of cash outside the of which we view  as un-trapped and
available to be repatriated to the US Recall that as per the European Union ruling
Apple needs to keep  conversion rate  in an Escrow account
until the litigation in Europe is resolved Approximately  of Apple's annual global
earnings are foreign  Also  Apple has been provisioning for  taxes on about  of
its global earnings  at current tax rates and has been declaring the rest  which is
portion of its foreign earnings indefinitely reinvested outside the US  on which US taxes
are not provisioned If instead lower repatriation rate of  is applied on global
earnings  Apple could substantially repatriate all of its offshore un-trapped cash
 by paying the taxes already provisioned  which are sitting on its balance sheet
as deferred tax liability
In Figure  we show historical pre-tax earnings for Apple split into foreign pre-tax
earnings and  domestic pre-tax earnings  federal and state  In  about  of
Apples pre-tax earnings were foreign  out of total
Taxes that Apple provisions in any given year  and which do not actually get paid out
appear on Apples balance sheet as deferred tax liability Figure  shows that  as of
 the majority of the deferred tax liability on Apples balance sheet was due to
unremitted earnings for foreign subsidiaries  out of  or about
The new tax provision under the Trump administration lowers the repatriation tax rate
from  to  for liquid earnings held in cash As Figure  shows  the  of
deferred tax liability on Apples balance sheet would have been accrued at the prior
rate and so corresponds to about  of foreign earnings Apple also has not
provisioned taxes for  of foreign earnings  which it has identified so far as
indefinitely reinvested outside the If  repatriation rate is applied to this
total foreign earnings of on which taxes have already been provisioned
and  on which taxes have not been provisioned then Apples total bill for
repatriating its cash comes to  which is the amount the company already has on
its balance sheet as deferred tax liability
Apple Inc   January
CR
If the repatriation tax rate is reduced to  from the current  then Apple
should be able to repatriate substantially all of its foreign cash  without provisioning
for additional taxes  by paying out the deferred tax liability already on its balance
sheet After paying out the taxes  Apple would have  of cash back on-shore
in the which it could potentially use for buybacks  dividends  or M&A

Consensus  estimates still too low given ASP growth potential
In Figure  we parse iPhone ASP growth  by calendar year  into two factors  mix and
 new model price increase To see the impact of price increases  we keep mix fixed
by assuming  mix of new old phones per quarter  Also  as in years past  we
assume Apple continues to lower the price of existing phones by  when new
phones are released  As Figure  shows  even without any price increase for the new
iPhones announced in  the blended iPhone ASP grows from year-to-year in
 and  just from the impact of mix  So  even if there is no further price increase
for the phones to be released in iPhone  Plus blended iPhone ASP in  is
higher given the step-up from  will flow through to  If Apple can indeed
increase prices again in perhaps by offering phone with an even larger viewable
area then that can drive  and  ASP even higher   runway for ASPs is
underappreciated  in our view
Figure  presents various scenarios to show what  iPhone ASP could be if
iPhone  is priced  higher than current IPhone  Plus It also shows the
impact on  ASP if iPhone  Plus is priced  higher than iPhone
 We currently model iPhone blended ASP for  at  which from Figure
roughly corresponds to the scenario where iPhone  is priced  more than iPhone
Plus and iPhone  Plus is priced  more than iPhone

Stock correlated to gross profit dollar growth which remains positive
Our analysis suggests that Apples stock price is highly correlated to growth in gross
profit dollars In the prior down cycle  late  revenues decelerated to reach low-
single digits by  however  gross profit dollar growth turned significantly
negative  given gross margins were also declining  and the company was losing share to

one despite periods of slower growth of gross profit dollars  as long as the growth
remains positive

Lower commodity costs  and higher ASP can help gross margin
Smartphones  including iPhones  have been getting more powerful over the years and
have increased the amount of memory  DRAM  and storage  NAND  that they use

two years

As case in point  the new iPhones released in iPhone  Plus  start at
storage  NAND  configurations  vs  prior generations which started at Some
investors believe that Apple might introduce  storage configurations in iPhones in
 or  While iPhones up to iPhone  have  of memory  DRAM iPhone
Plus and iPhone come with
The growth of Spot and Contract prices and the increased use of DRAM and NAND have
certainly pressured Apples iPhone margins While NAND prices are expected to remain
stable  or decline sometime in  DRAM prices are expected to remain higher for
longer time than NAND
As commodity prices re-normalize  Apples margins on the iPhone may correspondingly
benefit  as we do not expect Apple to reduce prices of future generations of phones
Services can also drive revenue growth
While iPhone remains the key driver for Apples revenue and gross profit for the next
few years  longer-term investors should pay more attention to Services revenue  which
the company expects to double This includes both organic growth  as well
as growth via acquisitions Apples services revenue includes revenue from App store
Apple Music  iTunes  Apple Pay  Apple Care  Licensing  iCloud  and other Services
We currently model Services revenue growing from  in  to  in

Some customers waiting for larger OLED phone in
The iPhone allows for  OLED display edge-edge  given the shorter bezels  The
display size is larger than prior generations of iPhones  which had max display size of
 However  there is still significant set of customers who would prefer larger
screen size phones
Media reports have indicated the possibility of Apple launching  OLED phone in
 This would make it one of the largest phones on the market and would be
appealing to those Android users who have held out from joining the Apple ecosystem
waiting for an even bigger phone
AR VR remains major focus and possible driver of App revenue
When users compare iOS vs  Android ecosystems  the discussion necessarily centers on
the number and types of Apps available on Apples App store vs  on Google Play No
doubt the richness of the Apps available on iOS make iPhone and iPad the useful
products they are  and have helped to integrate them into users lives
In June  Apple reported that the App store had seen significant growth over the
past  months  with overall downloads up In addition  its global developer
community had earned over  since the App Store launched in  The
subscription business model is now available to developers across all  app categories
and App Stores active paid subscriptions were up  Customers enjoy
subscriptions across wide variety of services including Netflix  Hulu  Tastemade
mobile-first cooking network that has its own App and photo editing Apps like Over
and Enlight Apple typically keeps  and reports of the total App Store revenue
while the remaining  is paid to developers Starting last year  Apple indicated that
the revenue split would be Apple would take smaller cut  from those
developers who have customers signing up for subscriptions longer than year  This is
an added incentive for developers to stick with the iOS ecosystem

Optionality afforded by large cash balance to enter new markets
Figure  summarizes the opportunities for Apple to grow its revenue in traditional and
new markets Based on Apples calendar  revenue in smartphones  tablets
Apple Watch and Macs  in the respective years there is an incremental
consumer market sized  in which Apple can increase its share  the
consumer market opportunity is  in fact  larger given portion of Apples
 revenue is from Enterprise
Moreover  looking at other areas of consumer spend  we estimate additional market
opportunities sized including the TV market  and excluding the TV
market  This reinforces our opinion that Apple has ample opportunity to
develop modify and introduce new product categories in order to grow revenues

As seen in Figure  above  the Mar  Jun  and Sep  quarters resulted in
significant positive estimate revisions for  earnings  as seen by the step function
changes in revisions in those timeframes The Dec  quarter  however  has resulted in
almost no change  and given the risk of deceleration over the next two quarters  the
likelihood of negative revisions is significantly increasing

Batterygate  At least PR annoyance
Recent revelations that Apple had been throttling CPU speeds lower on older iPhones
 and SE  in order to counter degrading battery performance created public
relations annoyance for the company Apple has acknowledged the throttling and is
offering replacement batteries for older iPhones at  discount  versus prior
 The company also issued statement clarifying that its intent was not to degrade
user experience in order to drive customer upgrades Instead  it was trying to smooth
peaks of CPU activity in order to prevent the iPhones from shutting down unexpectedly
in cold weather or as the battery aged Users have reported CPU performance
improvement once the battery is replaced
In an environment where consumers are looking at device specifications critically  and where
lots of lower cost competitor products have similar functionality  changes such as these  behind
the scenes  and without customer knowledge  can certainly cause users to be annoyed
 represents near-term peak for iPhone shipments by our model
We model  iPhone units for the Dec quarter  which is the highest quarterly
iPhone shipment expected in Similarly  we model the next peak in Dec
 quarter  at similar peak level of  units In fact  we model the next peak
after that to also be at similar level of  units in Dec  quarter

Apple Inc AAPL
Our PO of  is based on  our  EPS estimate of  Our target multiple
compares to the long-term historical range of median  We believe higher
than historical multiple is justified given the anticipation of strong upcoming iPhone
cycle where we expect smoother  more consistent growth in iPhone units  We also think
  multiple is justified given large cash balance and opportunity to diversify into new
end markets and  and increasing mix of services  The multiple also reflects the potential
for new repatriation tax laws that would allow for repatriation of significant portion of
the company's foreign cash
Downside risks are  the potential implementation of border adjusted tax  trade
conflicts and stronger USD  Other risks are  Apple's significant exposure to the iPhone
commoditization in the smartphone market  intensifying competition in the tablet
market  managing beat and raise expectations for EPS estimates  and accelerating pace
of product innovation impacting margins
