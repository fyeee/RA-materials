How Bad Will Apple's Guidance Be
Smartphone upgrade rates remain at record low levels and do not appear
poised to rebound in the first calendar quarter Reduced iPhone
promotions could be having an impact as previously discussed but the
sustained lengthening of the replacement cycle appears driven simply by
customer choice to hold onto their phone longer We reduced our
estimates in Apple as detailed in the note below and are concerned that
revenue guidance for the March quarter could be as low as  billion
versus consensus of  billion

Upgrade rates still dropping
This week Verizon reported  decline in smartphones sold in  on
upgrade rate its lowest  upgrade rate of the past decade and at levels more
typically seen in June quarter We expect Verizon's peers to report similar
metrics although to be fair there are other devices in the mix that could be
pushing reported upgrade rates lower On the bright side for Apple Verizon's
device ASP was  higher than we expected and there could be signs that
upgrade rates are bottoming out for
Units are still growing but can ASP deliver on consensus revenue
Concerns about iPhone sales have been well documented Apple's stock has
shrugged off slew of analyst and press reports that highlight these trends
Despite these concerns Apple will still be able to grow its iPhone unit sales
just not necessarily at the rate that consensus expects The incremental
concern is whether Apple's can hit or even come close to consensus revenue
estimates in future quarters due to its reliance on ASP growth ASPs are now
much more difficult to predict due to Apple's broader and more price diverse
product line
We believe revenue guidance for March could be as low as  billion
We believe guidance for  revenue could be as low as  billion compared
to current consensus of  billion We reduced our  revenue estimate by
 billion primarily based on  million reduction in the number of iPhones
we expect to be sold to  million This was partially offset by  increase in
our ASP assumption detailed below and higher estimates for the iPad and
Services segments Our estimate reflects sequential decline in iPhone ASP
while the consensus estimate assumes sequential rise in ASP which has not
happened since  when Verizon first started selling the CDMA version of
the iPhone

Our  revenue estimate is  billion below consensus but reflects
growth
We cut our Calendar  revenue estimate by  million to
billion which implies  growth We are  billion below the consensus
estimate of  billion which implies  growth Our revisions were driven
by  reduction in our estimate of phones sold for the year to  million
from  million offset by  increase in our iPhone ASP estimate to
Our new ASP estimate reflects  annual increase compared to our prior
estimate of  increase
Lower tax rate means higher EPS
 lower tax rate assumption of  versus our prior estimate of
cushions the revenue reduction and actually increases our Calendar  EPS
estimate to  from  Our calendar  EPS estimate is currently
 above consensus but likely because consensus has not been adjusted for
the change in the tax code
Estimates may have to come down but does the stock
Apple has shrugged off slew of press reports and analyst notes highlighting
the risk to iPhone sales However the unpredictability of the ASP could be
the Achilles heel or maybe slingshot for the stock Our estimate of
revenue growth may be notably lower than consensus but it's still impressive
for company at Apple's size and margin profile thereby deserving
reasonable multiple of Earnings
Our  target which remains unchanged is based on  was  our
Calendar  EPS estimate of  That is discount to the current
multiple of the S&P  of  Our target implies free cash flow yield of

We recommend that investors avoid trading the quarter given the wide range
of ASP outcomes discussed below It’s possible if not probable that Apple's
stock could take more than  hit if Apple issues the March quarter guidance
that we outline Even if this occurs we believe Apple can hit our  price
target by the end of the year based on the strong recurring revenue dynamics
of its growth business expanding margins and share repurchase activity
The Art of Estimating iPhone ASPs
Estimating iPhone ASPs relies on making assumptions on product and SKU
mix Even if you are successful at predicting product mix using the iPhone list
price is not reliable based on moves in currency and the likelihood that Apple
discounts products in select markets throughout the world Take the June
quarter for example Reported ASP was  but the only products with list
price below that level are the iPhone  and the iPhone SE
models  It appears that we need to apply  discount to an
ASP that is calculated from list price in order to come up with our best guess
on ASP As you will see in the analysis below you can drive truck through the
ASP range based on the range of iPhone product mix
Mix of iPhone is critical to predict ASP in
The key to figuring out the ASP in calendar  is knowing the mix of iPhone
given its very high ASP Supplies of the iPhone were constrained at the
November  launch but it was readily available by the end of the year and
should not have limited sales in the quarter Despite its availability operator
promotions were far less aggressive than prior years and ended up being more
focused on Buy One Get One Free BOGO for the iPhone  rather than on
the iPhone Link
Stop calling it super-cycle
This is an off-cycleS-Model year which is important to consider when some of
our peers push the questionable thesis of this being  year There
is no evidence from the operators to suggest there is  but our
visibility into China is admittedly very limited If Apple sold  million phones
in  it would reflect  increase over last year  million phones sold in
the March quarter implies  growth As point of reference the  launch
in  true super cycle resulted in  unit growth in that December
quarter and  in the subsequent March quarter Just take look at the spike
in Verizon's upgrade rate in the very first chart of this report

Did the iPhone represent  of sales in December quarter
The table below shows the range of estimates that exist for the mix of phones
sold in the December quarter Our range of estimates implies  to  of
phones sold in the quarter were iPhone As point of reference Wave
Research ran surveys in stores in the United States in November and
December that indicated that iPhone represented  and  of
iPhones sold in those months respectively It's certainly possible that the mix
of customers electing to have their phones shipped which would not be
captured by their survey was more highly weighted to iPhone
When have legacy products represented  of phones sold
We also estimate relatively high mix of iPhone  in our December
estimates and they are also new product In fact at the high end of our
range legacy products represent less than  of phones sold in the quarter
which seems implausible based on prior discussions with operators
What memory are consumers buying
ASP is also impacted by the mix of SKU or what memory size the consumer
buys We included the mix of SKUs determined by survey work from Wave
Research in the United States for purposes of comparison For legacy
products which includes iPhone  we simply reduced the June quarter
ASP by  to account for stated price reductions The resulting range
of ASPs based on this analysis is
Who is getting discount on iPhones Not operators in the US
Experience has taught us that we should apply  discount to this basic
math to better predict ASP and presumably account for market discounts to
certain markets and distribution channels To be clear we do not believe that
wireless operators in the United States receive product discounts In fact they
pay Apple commissions for phones activated in Apple Stores

 billion swing in revenue based on the range of estimates on mix
The net result of all the assumptions detailed above is an ASP range of
 which implies revenue range of  to  billion based on  million
units sold We will use the midpoint of that range in our model of  which
is up from our prior estimate of  but clearly that is really wide range of
outcomes If Apple executed at the high end of the range it would result in
total revenue of  billion which compares to guidance of  billion and
consensus of  billion The low end of the range implies  revenue of
billion
Cutting our March quarter iPhone estimates to  million
We are lowering our iPhone unit estimate for the March quarter to  million
from  million based on more conservative outlook for upgrade rates Our
new estimate represents  annual unit growth which is consistent with the
low single digit growth of the past few quarters but is lower than our prior
estimate of
Our new unit estimate also implies  sequential decline which is in-line
with the declines over the prior two years Bulls could argue that the
November launch of the iPhone should provide an easier comparable
thereby rendering our  sequential decline estimate too conservative
 sequential decline would imply  million phones sold and lift our revenue
estimate by  billion to  billion which is the consensus estimate for the
March quarter  million units does not seem like an easy comparable to us
so we will stick with our estimate of  million iPhones sold for the March
quarter

Can ASP rise sequentially in the March quarter
We believe the  billion consensus revenue estimate for the March quarter
implies rise in iPhone ASP This is likely driven by the belief that the
November  launch of the iPhone and limited supply would help the
iPhone mix in the March quarter compared to the December quarter It is
definitely plausible that Apple could sell similar number of iPhone in the
March quarter as it did in the December quarter when they were only selling
the iPhone for two months However the supplydemand of that phone did
quickly move into balance during the December quarter and phone
promotions have remain focused on iPhone  typical seasonal trend is
 sequential drop in iPhone ASP in the March quarter The reality likely
falls somewhere in between as we forecast and is shown in the chart below

What will the mix of phones be in the March quarter
The table below shows range of estimates for the mix of phones sold in the
March quarter This time we also provide range for the total number of
phones sold of  million given the reduction we made to our estimates
This range of total phones sold implies annual growth of  both
impressive but clearly very wide range once again
The mix of phones is also critical If the iPhone mix in the March quarter can
exceed the  mix at the mid point of the range in the December quarter
Apple will have shot at growing ASPs sequentially and delivering on
consensus revenue estimates However that implies very low mix of legacy
iPhone sales
No adjustment to SKU mix
We did not make adjustments to our mix of SKU compared to the December
quarter although it's reasonable to assume that the mix would move down to
lower priced models after the initial launch The table below includes some
more recent survey work from Wave  Research which shows an expected
increase in mix for the iPhone
We expect March ASP to drop sequentially to  the low end of our
range
Our estimates for the March quarter imply an ASP range of   We
apply  discount to this basic math in order to generate an estimated
reported ASP range of  In the March and June quarters discounts
are likely to be larger as Apple moves inventory with lower prices in select
markets

We will use the low end of the range for our  estimates
We will use the lower end of the ASP range in our model since our unit
estimate is now  million for the quarter Our new ASP estimate of  for
the March quarter is up  from our prior estimate but down  from the
December quarter and likely below consensus
Is  revenue growth really disappointment
Cutting our iPhone unit estimate to  million from  million and increasing
our ASP estimate to  from  reduces our iPhone revenue estimate to
 billion from  billion Our new estimate implies  iPhone revenue
growth which is very impressive but is down from our prior estimate of
growth These estimates also yield  billion total revenue estimate which
will be the headline guidance number that investors are waiting for when the
company reports
How do you get to  billion in revenue guidance
If we assumed the high end of the range in the tables above  million phones
sold at an ASP of  it would lift our iPhone revenue estimate by  billion
and imply an astounding  iPhone revenue growth Apple has not grown
iPhone revenue that much since with the true super-cycle of the
iPhone  Furthermore it would lift our total revenue estimate for the
March quarter to  billion which is  billion above consensus That level of
revenue would reflect  growth compared to last year Apple reports Feb
 after the close
