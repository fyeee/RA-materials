The Art of Estimating iPhone ASPs
Estimating iPhone ASPs relies on making assumptions on product and SKU

price is not reliable based on moves in currency and the likelihood that Apple
discounts products in select markets throughout the  Take the June
 for  Reported ASP was  but the only products with a list
price below that level are the iPhone    and the iPhone SE
models  It appears that we need to apply a  discount to an
ASP that is calculated from list price in order to come up with our best guess
on  As you will see in the analysis  you can drive a truck through the
ASP range based on the range of iPhone product
