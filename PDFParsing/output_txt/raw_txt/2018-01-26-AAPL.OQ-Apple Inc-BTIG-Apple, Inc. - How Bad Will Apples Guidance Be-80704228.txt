How Bad Will Apple's Guidance Be? 

 

Smartphone upgrade rates remain at record low levels and do not appear 
poised to rebound in the first calendar quarter. Reduced iPhone 
promotions could be having an impact (as previously discussed), but the 
sustained lengthening of the replacement cycle appears driven simply by 
customer choice to hold onto their phone longer. We reduced our 
estimates in Apple as detailed in the note below and are concerned that 
revenue guidance for the March quarter could be as low as $60 billion 
versus a consensus of $68 billion.

Upgrade rates still dropping 

This week, Verizon reported a 7% decline in smartphones sold in Q4 on a 7.2% 
upgrade rate, its lowest Q4 upgrade rate of the past decade and at levels more 
typically seen in a June quarter. We expect Verizon's peers to report similar 
metrics, although to be fair there are other devices in the mix that could be 
pushing reported upgrade rates lower. On the bright side for Apple, Verizon's 
device ASP was $50 higher than we expected and there could be signs that 
upgrade rates are bottoming out for 2018. 

 

Units are still growing, but can ASP deliver on consensus revenue?  

Concerns about iPhone X sales have been well documented. Apple's stock has 
shrugged off a slew of analyst and press reports that highlight these trends. 
Despite these concerns, Apple will still be able to grow its iPhone unit sales, 
just not necessarily at the rate that consensus expects. The incremental 
concern is whether Apple's can hit or even come close to consensus revenue 
estimates in future quarters, due to its reliance on ASP growth. ASPs are now 
much more difficult to predict due to Apple's broader and more price diverse 
product line. 

We believe revenue guidance for March could be as low as $60 billion 

We believe guidance for FQ2 revenue could be as low as $60 billion compared 
to current consensus of $68 billion. We reduced our FQ2 revenue estimate by 
$2.5 billion primarily based on a 7 million reduction in the number of iPhones 
we expect to be sold to 53 million. This was partially offset by a $33 increase in 
our ASP assumption, detailed below, and higher estimates for the iPad and 
Services segments. Our estimate reflects a sequential decline in iPhone ASP, 
while the consensus estimate assumes a sequential rise in ASP, which has not 
happened since 2011 when Verizon first started selling the CDMA version of 
the iPhone 4.

Our 2018 revenue estimate is $13 billion below consensus, but reflects 11% 
growth  

We cut our Calendar 2018 revenue estimate by $500 million to $262 
billion, which implies 11% growth. We are $13 billion below the consensus 
estimate of $275 billion, which implies 17% growth. Our revisions were driven 
by a 6% reduction in our estimate of phones sold for the year to 226.5 million 
from 240.0 million offset by a $32 increase in our iPhone ASP estimate to $721. 
Our new ASP estimate reflects a 7% annual increase compared to our prior 
estimate of a 4% increase. 

 

Lower tax rate means higher EPS 

A lower tax rate assumption of 19% versus our prior estimate of 25.5% 
cushions the revenue reduction and actually increases our Calendar 2018 EPS 
estimate to $12.00 from $11.00. Our calendar 2018 EPS estimate is currently 
$0.25 above consensus, but likely because consensus has not been adjusted for 
the change in the tax code. 

Estimates may have to come down, but does the stock? 

Apple has shrugged off a slew of press reports and analyst notes highlighting 
the risk to iPhone sales. However, the unpredictability of the ASP could be 
the Achilles heel (or maybe slingshot) for the stock. Our estimate of 11% 
revenue growth may be notably lower than consensus, but it's still impressive 
for a company at Apple's size and margin profile, thereby deserving a 
reasonable multiple of Earnings. 

Our $198 target, which remains unchanged, is based on 16.5x (was 18.0x) our 
Calendar 2018 EPS estimate of $12.00. That is a discount to the current 
multiple of the S&P 500 of 18.6x. Our target implies a free cash flow yield of 
6.8%.

We recommend that investors avoid trading the quarter given the wide range 
of ASP outcomes discussed below. It’s possible, if not probable, that Apple's 
stock could take a more than 5% hit if Apple issues the March quarter guidance 
that we outline. Even if this occurs, we believe Apple can hit our $198 price 
target by the end of the year based on the strong recurring revenue dynamics 
of its growth business, expanding margins and share repurchase activity. 

The Art of Estimating iPhone ASPs 

Estimating iPhone ASPs relies on making assumptions on product and SKU 
mix. Even if you are successful at predicting product mix, using the iPhone list 
price is not reliable based on moves in currency and the likelihood that Apple 
discounts products in select markets throughout the world. Take the June 2017 
quarter, for example. Reported ASP was $606, but the only products with a list 
price below that level are the iPhone 6S 16GB ($549) and the iPhone SE 
models ($399-$499). It appears that we need to apply a 5%-10% discount to an 
ASP that is calculated from list price in order to come up with our best guess 
on ASP. As you will see in the analysis below, you can drive a truck through the 
ASP range based on the range of iPhone product mix. 

Mix of iPhone X is critical to predict ASP in Q4 

The key to figuring out the ASP in calendar Q4 is knowing the mix of iPhone X 
given its very high ASP. Supplies of the iPhone X were constrained at the 
November 2nd launch, but it was readily available by the end of the year and 
should not have limited sales in the quarter. Despite its availability, operator 
promotions were far less aggressive than prior years and ended up being more 
focused on Buy One Get One Free (BOGO) for the iPhone 8/8+, rather than on 
the iPhone X. (Link) 

 

Stop calling it a super-cycle 

This is an off-cycle/S-Model year, which is important to consider when some of 
our peers push the questionable thesis of this being a "super-cycle" year. There 
is no evidence from the operators to suggest there is a "super-cycle", but our 
visibility into China is admittedly very limited. If Apple sold 80 million phones 
in Q4 it would reflect a 2.2% increase over last year. 61 million phones sold in 
the March quarter implies 20% growth. As a point of reference, the 6/6+ launch 
in 2014 (a true super cycle) resulted in 46% unit growth in that December 
quarter and 40% in the subsequent March quarter. Just take a look at the spike 
in Verizon's upgrade rate in the very first chart of this report.

Did the iPhone X represent 36-46% of sales in December quarter? 

The table below shows the range of estimates that exist for the mix of phones 
sold in the December quarter. Our range of estimates implies 36% to 44% of 
phones sold in the quarter were iPhone X. As a point of reference Wave 7 
Research ran surveys in stores in the United States in November and 
December that indicated that iPhone X represented ~12% and ~25% of 
iPhones sold in those months, respectively. It's certainly possible that the mix 
of customers electing to have their phones shipped (which would not be 
captured by their survey) was more highly weighted to iPhone X. 

When have legacy products represented <20% of phones sold? 

We also estimate a relatively high mix of iPhone 8/8+ in our December 
estimates, and they are also a new product. In fact, at the high end of our 
range, legacy products represent less than 20% of phones sold in the quarter, 
which seems implausible based on prior discussions with operators. 

 

What memory are consumers buying? 

ASP is also impacted by the mix of SKU, or what memory size the consumer 
buys. We included the mix of SKUs determined by survey work from Wave 7 
Research in the United States for purposes of comparison. For legacy 
products, which includes iPhone SE/6S/7, we simply reduced the June quarter 
ASP by $100-$125 to account for stated price reductions. The resulting range 
of ASPs based on this analysis is $757-$859. 

Who is getting a discount on iPhones? Not operators in the US  

Experience has taught us that we should apply a 5%-10% discount to this basic 
math to better predict ASP and presumably account for market discounts to 
certain markets and distribution channels. To be clear, we do not believe that 
wireless operators in the United States receive product discounts. In fact, they 
pay Apple commissions for phones activated in Apple Stores.

$10 billion swing in revenue based on the range of estimates on mix  

The net result of all the assumptions detailed above is an ASP range of $682-
$816, which implies a revenue range of $55 to $65 billion based on 80 million 
units sold. We will use the midpoint of that range in our model of $750, which 
is up from our prior estimate of $722, but clearly that is a really wide range of 
outcomes. If Apple executed at the high end of the range it would result in 
total revenue of $91 billion, which compares to guidance of $84-$87 billion and 
consensus of $87 billion. The low end of the range implies FQ1 revenue of $81 
billion. 

Cutting our March quarter iPhone estimates to 53 million 

We are lowering our iPhone unit estimate for the March quarter to 53 million 
from 60 million based on a more conservative outlook for upgrade rates. Our 
new estimate represents 4% annual unit growth, which is consistent with the 
low single digit growth of the past few quarters, but is lower than our prior 
estimate of 18%. 

Our new unit estimate also implies a 33% sequential decline, which is in-line 
with the declines over the prior two years. Bulls could argue that the 
November launch of the iPhone X should provide an easier comparable, 
thereby rendering our 33% sequential decline estimate too conservative. A 
20% sequential decline would imply 60 million phones sold and lift our revenue 
estimate by $7.3 billion to $68 billion, which is the consensus estimate for the 
March quarter. 80 million units does not seem like an easy comparable to us, 
so we will stick with our estimate of 53 million iPhones sold for the March 
quarter.

Can ASP rise sequentially in the March quarter? 

We believe the $68 billion consensus revenue estimate for the March quarter 
implies a rise in iPhone ASP. This is likely driven by the belief that the 
November 2nd launch of the iPhone X and limited supply would help the 
iPhone X mix in the March quarter compared to the December quarter. It is 
definitely plausible that Apple could sell a similar number of iPhone X in the 
March quarter as it did in the December quarter when they were only selling 
the iPhone X for two months. However, the supply/demand of that phone did 
quickly move into balance during the December quarter and phone 
promotions have remain focused on iPhone 8s. A typical seasonal trend is a 
4%-7% sequential drop in iPhone ASP in the March quarter. The reality likely 
falls somewhere in between, as we forecast and is shown in the chart below.

What will the mix of phones be in the March quarter? 

The table below shows a range of estimates for the mix of phones sold in the 
March quarter. This time we also provide a range for the total number of 
phones sold of 53-63 million, given the reduction we made to our estimates. 
This range of total phones sold implies annual growth of 4%-18%, both 
impressive, but clearly a very wide range, once again. 

 

The mix of phones is also critical. If the iPhone X mix in the March quarter can 
exceed the 40% mix at the mid point of the range in the December quarter, 
Apple will have a shot at growing ASPs sequentially and delivering on 
consensus revenue estimates. However, that implies a very low mix of legacy 
iPhone sales. 

No adjustment to SKU mix 

We did not make adjustments to our mix of SKU compared to the December 
quarter although it's reasonable to assume that the mix would move down to 
lower priced models after the initial launch. The table below includes some 
more recent survey work from Wave 7 Research, which shows an expected 
increase in mix for the iPhone 8/8+. 

 

We expect March ASP to drop sequentially to $720, the low end of our 
range 

Our estimates for the March quarter imply an ASP range of $783 - $879. We 
apply a 5%-10% discount to this basic math in order to generate an estimated 
reported ASP range of $705-$835. In the March and June quarters, discounts 
are likely to be larger as Apple moves inventory with lower prices in select 
markets.

We will use the low end of the range for our FQ2 estimates 

We will use the lower end of the ASP range in our model since our unit 
estimate is now 53 million for the quarter. Our new ASP estimate of $720 for 
the March quarter is up $32 from our prior estimate, but down $30 from the 
December quarter and likely below consensus. 

Is 15% revenue growth really a disappointment? 

Cutting our iPhone unit estimate to 53 million from 60 million and increasing 
our ASP estimate to $720 from $688 reduces our iPhone revenue estimate to 
$38 billion from $41 billion. Our new estimate implies 15% iPhone revenue 
growth, which is very impressive, but is down from our prior estimate of 24% 
growth. These estimates also yield a $60 billion total revenue estimate, which 
will be the headline guidance number that investors are waiting for when the 
company reports FQ1. 

How do you get to $68 billion in revenue guidance? 

If we assumed the high end of the range in the tables above (63 million phones 
sold at an ASP of $835) it would lift our iPhone revenue estimate by $14 billion 
and imply an astounding 58% iPhone revenue growth. Apple has not grown 
iPhone revenue that much since FQ1-FQ3 2015 with the true super-cycle of the 
iPhone 6/6+. Furthermore, it would lift our total revenue estimate for the 
March quarter to $75 billion, which is $7 billion above consensus. That level of 
revenue would reflect 41% growth compared to last year. Apple reports Feb 
1st after the close.

BUY  –  A  security  which  is  expected  to  produce  a  positive  total  return  of  15%  or  greater  over  the  12  months 
following  the  recommendation.  The  BUY  rating  may  be  maintained  as  long  as  it  is  deemed  appropriate, 
notwithstanding price fluctuations that would cause the target to fall outside of the 15% return. 
SELL – A security which is expected to produce a negative total return of 15% or greater over the next 12 months 
following  the  recommendation.  The  SELL  rating  may  be  maintained  as  long  as  it  is  deemed  appropriate, 
notwithstanding price fluctuations that would cause the target to fall outside of the 15% return. 
NEUTRAL – A security which is not expected to appreciate or depreciate meaningfully over the next 12 months. 
NOT RATED – A security which is not rated or covered by BTIG. 
UNDER  REVIEW  –  Effective  immediately,  coverage  of  the  following  securities  is  Under  Review.  Ratings,  price

must  also  disclose  the  percentage  of  subject  companies  within  each  of  these  three  categories  for  whom  the 
member has provided investment banking services within the previous twelve months. Stocks under coverage as 
of the end of the most recent calendar quarter (December 31, 2017): 278 
  
Distribution of BTIG’s Research Recommendations (as of December 31, 2017):

Company Valuation and Risk Disclosures 
Apple, Inc. (AAPL, Buy, $198.00 PT) 
Valuation:  Our  $198  price  target  is  based  on  16.5x  our  CY  2018  EPS  estimate  of  $12.00,  which  reflects  25% 
growth in that year. Our price target implies a free cash flow yield of 6.8% and 8.0% if you reduced the market cap 
by the more than $150 billion of net cash. 
Risks:  Apple  competes  against  a  number  of  traditional  and  start-up  wireless  device  manufacturers  who  are 
constantly  bringing  new  products  to  market  that  could  potentially  take  share  from  the  company.  These 
competitors could also be more willing to cut prices and have promotional offers in the market.

Verizon Communications, Inc. (VZ, Neutral),                      PT) 
Valuation:  We  value  companies  based  on  a  variety  of  valuation  techniques  including  Revenue  multiples, 
Enterprise Value to EBITDA multiples, Price to Earnings, Free Cash Flow multiples, and Sum-of-the-Parts. In the 
case  of  Verizon,  current  multiples  do  not  indicate  that  the  company  will  trade  outside  of  +/-  15%  from  current 
levels over the next 12 months. Note that BTIG does not assign specific price targets to Neutral-rated stocks. 
Risks: The risks to our Neutral rating is that Verizon is able to increase pricing on customers that are not willing to 
leave  them  because  of  the  greater  coverage  of  their  wireless  networks,  thereby  driving  EBITDA,  free  cash  flow 
and EPS higher than our estimate. Verizon could also make a large acquisition in order to pivot to a strategy that

Facts,  views  or  opinions  presented  in  this  report  have  not  been  reviewed  by,  and  may  not  reflect  information 
known to, employees or other professionals in the “BTIG Group” (BTIG Group includes, but is not limited to, BTIG 
and  its  parents,  subsidiaries  and/or  affiliates).  BTIG  Group  employees,  including  Sales  Representatives  and 
Traders,  may  provide  oral  or  written  commentary  or  advice  that  may  be  inconsistent  with  the  opinions  and/or

this report that are inconsistent with the views discussed in this report. 
 
Investors in securities products bear certain risks in conjunction with those investments. The value of, and income 
from, any investments may vary because of changes in interest rates or foreign exchange rates, securities prices 
or  market  indexes,  operational  or  financial  conditions  of  companies  or  other  factors  within  or  beyond  the 
companies  control.  Recipient  of  the  research  reports  should  be  aware  that  investments  in  securities  may  pose 
significant  risks  due  to  the  inherent  uncertainty  associated  with  relying  on  forecasts  of  various  factors  that  can 
affect  the  earnings,  cash  flow  and  overall  valuation  of  a  company.  Any  investment  in  securities  should  be 
undertaken  only  upon  consideration  of  issues  relating  to  the  recipient’s  overall  investment  portfolio  and 
objectives (such as diversification by asset class, industry or company) as well as time horizon and liquidity needs. 
Further,  past  performance  should  not  be  taken  as  an  indication  or  guarantee  of  future  performance,  and  no 
representation  or  warranty,  express  or  implied,  is  made  regarding  future  performance.  There  may  be  time 
limitations on the exercise of options or other rights in any securities transactions. 
 
Investing  in  foreign  markets  and  securities,  including  ADRs,  is  subject  to  additional  risks  such  as  currency 
fluctuation, limited information, political instability, economic risk, and the potential for illiquid markets. Investing 
in emerging markets may accentuate these risks. Non-U.S. reporting issuers of foreign securities, however, may 
not  make  regular  or  complete  public  disclosure  relating  to  their  financial  condition  or  the  securities  that  they 
issue.
