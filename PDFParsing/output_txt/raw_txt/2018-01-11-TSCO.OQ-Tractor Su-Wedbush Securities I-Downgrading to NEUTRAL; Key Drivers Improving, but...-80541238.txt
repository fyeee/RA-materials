Tractor Supply Company  (TSCO)

Downgrading to NEUTRAL; Key Drivers Improving, but
Margin Pressures Persist

  
The Wedbush View

Comp  drags  in  recent  years  of  weather,  energy  markets  and  deflation  continue
to lessen or inflect positively. Most notably, favorable weather conditions—colder
than  expected  temperatures  in  November  and  December—likely  drove  strong
sales in winter seasonal product categories including fuel, insulated outerwear and
power equipment, leading us to boost our 4Q17 estimates above consensus. At
the same time, while the weather forecast for 1Q18 looks favorable against easy
comparisons, and company-specific drivers have legs, continued SG&A pressures
including omnichannel spending may lead to initial implied 2018 operating margin
guidance below consensus. At 20x 2018E EPS including estimated net tax reform
benefits, TSCO appears fairly valued for ~11% long-term EPS growth, leading us to
downgrade shares from OUTPERFORM to NEUTRAL but raise our price target to
$80 (from $72).
Weather  a  nice  boost  for  4Q17,  leading  us  to  raise  our  estimates.  Favorable
weather  conditions—colder  than  expected  temperatures  in  November  and
December  (see  Figure  3)—likely  drove  strong  sales  in  winter  seasonal  product
categories  including  fuel,  insulated  outerwear  and  power  equipment.  Indeed,
Planalytics, a weather-intelligence firm, reported strong weather-driven demand
for the heating (+21% Nov; +5% Dec) and outerwear categories (+5% Nov; -1% Dec)
despite lapping significantly tougher comparisons (see Figure 4). Based primarily
on more favorable than expected weather, we are raising our 4Q comp estimate
to  3.0%  from  1.0%  (vs.  consensus  1.7%)  and  our  EPS  to  $0.88  from  $0.85  (vs.
consensus $0.86).

Expect  modest  margin  upside  in  4Q  with  more  limited  seasonal  markdowns
and  SG&A  pressures.  Cold  weather  in  November  and  better  than  anticipated
sales trends in December, despite the tougher comparison, should limit seasonal
markdown pressure. We recall in 4Q16 that comps were strong (+3.1% or +3.8%
calendar-adjusted), but gross margins declined 35 bps y/y in part due to higher
promotions in an effort to drive traffic to stores. Given that December did not prove
to  be  the  headwind  that  it  was  expected  to  be,  we  estimate  flat  gross  margins
(in  line  with  consensus).  We  expect  modest  contributions  from  TSCO’s  ongoing
initiatives  associated  with  price  management  and  inventory  management  to  be
offset by increased freight and fulfillment expenses; other headwinds may include
stronger performance in the CUE segment which operates at lower margins (an
estimated ~400 bps) than other product segments. Given stronger sales, we now
expect SG&A as a % of sales to come in at the low end of the company’s 4Q guidance
of 80-100 bps of y/y deleverage. The company continues to invest in labor hours
to improve customer service levels and depreciation is growing at a rate faster rate
than sales due to strategic investments in technology and supply chain investments.
As well, incentive compensation is normalizing, pressuring SG&A.

Investment Overview

 

Weather,  deflation  and  oil-economy  cyclical  pressures  should  continue  to  ease  into  2018,  boosting  comps.
Meanwhile,  improvements  in  merchandising,  omnichannel,  a  new  loyalty  program,  extended  aisle  and  in-store
pickup, should also help comps. That said, we expect continued elevated investments weighing on margins. Excluding
tax  reform  benefits  and  related  reinvestments,  we  see  potential  for  initial  2018  margin  and  EPS  guidance  to
disappoint. Moreover, tax reform benefits appear mostly priced in.

Downgrading to NEUTRAL; Key Drivers Improving, but Margin Pressures 
Persist  

 
The  Wedbush  View.    Comp  drags  in  recent  years  of  weather,  energy  markets  and  deflation 
continue to lessen or inflect positively. Most notably, favorable weather conditions—colder than 
expected temperatures in November and December—likely drove strong sales in winter seasonal

looks  favorable  against  easy  comparisons,  and  company-specific  drivers  have  legs,  continued 
SG&A  pressures  including  omnichannel  spending  may  lead  to  initial  implied  2018  operating 
margin guidance below consensus. At 20x 2018E EPS including estimated net tax reform benefits, 
TSCO appears fairly valued for ~11% long-term EPS growth, leading us to downgrade shares from 
OUTPERFORM to NEUTRAL but raise our price target to $80 (from $72).  
 
Weather  a  nice  boost  for  4Q17,  leading  us  to  raise  our  estimates.  Favorable  weather 
conditions—colder  than  expected  temperatures  in  November  and  December  (see  Figure  3)—
likely drove strong sales in winter seasonal product categories including fuel, insulated outerwear

driven  demand  for  the  heating  (+21%  Nov;  +5%  Dec)  and  outerwear  categories  (+5%  Nov;  -1% 
Dec)  despite  lapping  significantly  tougher  comparisons  (see  Figure  4).  Based  primarily  on  more

consensus 1.7%) and our EPS to $0.88 from $0.85 (vs. consensus $0.86).    
 
Expect  modest  margin  upside  in  4Q  with  more  limited  seasonal  markdowns  and  SG&A 
pressures.  Cold  weather  in  November  and  better  than  anticipated  sales  trends  in  December, 
despite  the  tougher  comparison,  should  limit  seasonal  markdown  pressure.  We  recall  in  4Q16 
that comps were strong (+3.1% or +3.8% calendar-adjusted), but gross margins declined 35 bps 
y/y in part due to higher promotions in an effort to drive traffic to stores. Given that December 
did not prove to be the headwind that it was expected to be, we estimate flat gross margins (in

improve customer service levels and depreciation is growing at a rate faster rate than sales due 
to  strategic  investments  in  technology  and  supply  chain  investments.  As  well,  incentive 
compensation is normalizing, pressuring SG&A.  
 
Weather forecast for 1Q18 favorable. In 1Q18, TSCO will be lapping its easiest comp comparison 
for  the  year  (-2.2%),  driven  primarily  by  unfavorable  weather—very  mild  winter  weather  in 
January and February diminished demand for winter seasonal products, while unseasonably cold 
and  snowy  weather  in  March  across  various  weather-sensitive  regions  diminished  demand  for 
spring seasonal products. The Weather Channel (TWC) forecasts 1Q temperatures to be slightly 
below average in the upper Midwest and parts of the Northeast, while the majority of the Mid-
Atlantic,  Southeast  and  parts  of  the  Midwest  and  Lower  Plains  may  experience  temperatures 
above average; this forecast is relatively consistent on a month-by-month basis (see Figures 5-8). 
Should  TWC’s  forecast  for  the  next  three  months  prove  accurate,  average  temperatures  in 
weather-sensitive  regions  we  track  would  decline  a  sharp  ~7⁰F  y/y  in  January  and  ~8⁰F  y/y  in 
February, which would much more favorable for winter category sales. More importantly, March 
temperatures  are  currently  forecasted  to  be  flat  y/y  despite  the  6⁰F  y/y  temperature  decline 
experienced  in  weather-sensitive  regions  in  March  2017  (see  Figure  9).  Flattish  temperatures 
coupled  with  easy  comparisons,  particularly  in  big  ticket  sales,  should  benefit  TSCO  comps, 
leaving us comfortable with our 1Q18 comps estimate of 4.0% vs. consensus 3.5%.

Initial  margin  guidance  for  2018  may  disappoint  modestly;  revising  estimates.  We  anticipate 
2018  annual  comp  guidance  to  be  somewhat  conservative  and  roughly  in  line  with  the  initial 
guidance provided last year including 2-3% comps and EPS growth in the +MSD-HSD range (see 
Figure  20).  Company-specific  initiatives  coupled  with  normalizing  winter  weather  and  easy 
comparisons through the key spring selling season point to a more favorable top-line outlook for 
2018, with potential upside to our 2.5% comp estimate (vs. consensus 2.4%). That said, we see 
additional  risk  to  margins  in  2018  as  TSCO  continues  to  invest  in  technology-related  and 
customer-centric initiatives, and faces other cost pressures including wage inflation and incentive 
compensation  costs,  leading  us  to  reduce  our  estimates.  Our  underlying  SG&A  margins  now 
stand  30  bps  above  consensus  and  our  operating  margins  now  stand  30  bps  below  consensus, 
leading us to reduce our underlying 2018 EPS estimate from $3.54 to $3.48.  
 
Tax  reform  benefits  likely  partially  reinvested.  Assuming  a  23%  tax  rate  going  forward  (down 
from 36.5% in 2017E), EPS will rise ~20% all else equal, to $4.18. However, we anticipate that at 
least  15%  of  tax  expense  savings  will  be  reinvested  back  into  the  business  given  even  more 
significant  reinvestment  plans  by  home  improvement  peers  such  as  HD  and  FND.  Accordingly, 
our new 2018 EPS estimate is $4.08 (see Figure 1 and Figures 21-23 for more detail).

TSCO big ticket comps bounced in 3Q to out-comp LOW, but we expect relative performance to 
weaken  going  forward.  For the first time in nine quarters, TSCO out-comped one of the home 
centers  (HD,  LOW)  in  3Q17  (see  Figures  10-11).  We  believe  a  key  reason  for  the  improvement 
was favorable weather and stronger big ticket comps. Hurricane-related demand for items such 
as  power  generators  fueled  +HSD  big  ticket  comps,  the  first  positive  performance  since  2Q15 
(see Figures  12-13). Although facing a tougher comparison in 4Q, we expect continued positive 
big ticket comps in 4Q17, driven by categories such as wood-burning fire places and log splitters. 
Cycling through pressure in gun safes should also help, as should improvement in discretionary 
demand in energy-centric markets. Nonetheless, we see more limited comp and big ticket comp 
drivers for TSCO than for the home centers. The home remodel cycle remains strong, with solid 
demand  for  growth  in  appliances,  Pro  sales  and  remodeling  projects  to  which  TSCO  has  little 
exposure relative to the home centers.

Pressures  on  pet  category  likely  to  grow  from  online,  mass/grocery,  with  PetSmart  recent 
results  a  sign.  While  TSCO’s  Pet  and  Livestock  category  remains  strong,  we  see  an  increasing 
threat  from  the  online  and  mass/grocery  channels,  and  given  the  traffic-driving  nature  of  this 
core  CUE  category,  TSCO  risks  losing  other  (typically  higher-margin)  discretionary  sales  that 
accrue from the traffic. According to Packaged Facts, Internet sales accounted for 9% of the $48b 
U.S.  market  for  pet  products  in  2016,  and  this  likely  increased  to  a  LDD  mix  in  2017,  led  by 
outsized growth from AMZN. Internet sales continue to outpace and cannibalize sales from other 
channels, notably pet super stores like PetSmart. Indeed, according to One Click Retail, AMZN Pet 
Products  category  sales  in  the  12  month  period  ending  September,  2017  increased  33%  y/y  to 
$2.2b;  the  Pet  Food  &  Feeding  Supplies  sub-category  sales  increased  47%  y/y  to  $970m.  Also 
notable,  PetSmart  reported  30%  y/y  revenue  growth  in  3Q17  driven  entirely  by  its  ~$3b 
acquisition of Chewy.com, but revenue in its legacy business slipped by 1.5% and legacy business 
EBITDA  declined  15%  y/y;  management  also  uncharacteristically  refrained  from  guiding  4Q 
results.  Additional challenges include pet suppliers’ decision to shift to mass distribution as seen 
by Colgate-Palmolive (Science Diet) in 4Q16 and more recently, Blue Buffalo’s decision to sell its 
premium pet food brand in the mass and grocery channel.  
 
Company-specific initiatives on track. Benefits from sales-driving initiatives including buy-online-
pickup-in-store  (BOPIS)  and  its  Neighbor’s  Club  loyalty  program  should  continue  to  rise. 
Approximately  75%  of  online  orders  were  picked  up  at  stores  in  3Q  (up  from  55%  in  2Q), 
signaling  the  importance  of  the  bricks  and  mortar  location.  BOPIS  average  tickets  remain 
significantly  higher  than  the  company  average  and  customers  usually  buy  3.5  to  4  additional 
items when  they come into the store to pick up an online order, driving sales that are  ~2x the 
company’s  average  ticket  size.  As  well,  TSCO’s  Neighbor’s  Club  also  continues  to  gain  traction 
with over 5m members as of 3Q17, up from nearly 4m members in 2Q17. Members are receiving 
reward opportunities and personalized advertising based on transaction history, driving increases 
in  comp  transactions  and  basket  sizes.  Other  sales-driving  initiatives  still  being  piloted  include 
Mobile  POS  and  Stockyard  which  help  improve  checkout  speed  and  offer  an  “endless  aisle”  of 
merchandise. 
 
Deflation  to  ease  in  2018,  as  should  comp  drag  from  energy  markets.  While  we  forecast  a 
continued drag from deflation this quarter (30 bps), we see potential for receding deflation and a 
possible inflection to positive in 2018 based on improving corn and Brent crude oil futures prices. 
Corn  futures  and  oil  futures  historically  correlate  with  TSCO  inflation/deflation  impacts  on  a 
three quarter lagged basis (corn 0.85; oil: 0.67) since 2009. Corn futures have remained flattish in 
recent  months,  decreasing  -0.7%  in  4Q17  (vs.  8.4%  in  3Q),  and  oil  futures  increased  a  sharp 
20.4% in 4Q17 (vs. 11.1% in 3Q) (see Figures 16-17).

Weather a Nice Boost for 4Q17, with Favorable Forecast for 1Q18 

 
TSCO customers usually buy on a need-by-need basis and what weather they remember from the 
prior  year.  Despite  an  easy  comparison  through  October/November,  TSCO  noted  on  its  3Q 
earnings call (10/25/17) that October started off warm, likely clipping demand.  Colder weather 
started  to  materialize  in  November  and  continued  through  December,  with  average  daily 
temperatures in weather-sensitive regions in both months trending 3.9⁰F colder y/y (see Figure 
2). The December y/y decline was greater than expected, coming on top of a 9.5⁰F y/y decline in 
December 2016 (see Figure 3), which lifted sales in heating fuel, insulated outerwear and power 
equipment categories and contributed to a  strong 3.8% calendar-adjusted  comp in 4Q16 (3.1% 
reported). Favorable weather in 4Q17 leads us to raise our comp estimate to 3.0% from 1.0% (vs. 
consensus 1.7%). 
 
According  to  Planalytics,  a  weather  intelligence  firm,  national  weather-driven  demand  in 
categories such as heating and outerwear has been strong recently. Weather-driven demand for 
heating products across the country increased 3% in October (vs. +6% in Oct 2016) and increased 
a strong 21% in November (vs. -1% in Nov 2016); demand also increased 5% in December despite 
lapping a significant +47% in December 2016, suggesting continued strong sales. Weather-driven 
demand for outerwear increased 2% in October (vs. +6% in Oct 2016), increased 5% in November 
(vs. 0% in Nov 2016), but declined -1% in December (vs. +5% in Dec 2016) (see Figure 4).

In 1Q18, TSCO will be lapping its easiest comp comparison for the year (-2.2%), driven primarily 
by unfavorable weather—very mild winter weather in January and February diminished demand 
for  winter  seasonal  products,  while  unseasonably  cold  and  snowy  weather  in  March  across 
various weather-sensitive regions diminished demand for spring seasonal products. The Weather 
Channel (TWC) forecasts 1Q temperatures to be slightly below average in the upper Midwest and 
parts  of  the  Northeast,  while  the  majority  of  the  Mid-Atlantic,  Southeast  and  parts  of  the 
Midwest and Lower Plains may experience temperatures above average; this forecast is relatively 
consistent on a month-by-month basis (see Figures 5-8). Should TWC’s forecast for the next three 
months  prove  accurate,  average  temperatures  in  weather-sensitive  regions  we  track  would 
decline a sharp ~7⁰F y/y in January and ~8⁰F y/y in February, which would much more favorable 
for winter category sales. More importantly, March temperatures are currently forecasted to be 
flat  y/y  despite  the  6⁰F  y/y  temperature  decline  experienced  in  weather-sensitive  regions  in 
March 2017 (see Figure 9). Flattish temperatures coupled with easy comparisons, particularly in 
big  ticket  sales,  should  benefit  TSCO  comps,  leaving  us  comfortable  with  our  1Q18  comps 
estimate of 4.0% vs. consensus 3.5%.  
  
The largest weather catalyst of the quarter hinges on the timing of the spring season in March. 
TWC forecasts above-average temperatures in March in weather-sensitive regions, about in line 
with  those  last  year.  Flattish  temperatures  y/y  would  likely  be  positive  for  spring  seasonal 
products  (e.g.,  lawn  and  garden,  riding  lawn  mowers,  trailers,  fly  control)  relative  to  last  year, 
when  temperatures  declined  ~6⁰F  y/y  in  March.  We  also  note  that  a  -HSD  decline  in  big-ticket 
comps  was  a  primary  driver  behind  comp  weakness  in  1Q17,  primarily    due  to  both  the  tough 
comparison in March spring seasonal sales in the prior year period (big-ticket demand was flat to 
slightly positive excluding the comparison headwind), but also uncooperative weather. Given the 
substantially  easier  comparisons,  big-ticket  sales  may  increase  in  March  even  if  temperatures 
were to decline modestly y/y that month.

TSCO Big Ticket Comps Bounced in 3Q to Out-comp LOW, but We Expect 
Relative Performance to Weaken Going Forward 

 
For the first time in nine quarters, TSCO out-comped one of the home centers (HD, LOW) in 3Q17 
(see  Figures  10-11).  We  believe  a  key  reason  for  the  improvement  was  favorable  weather  and 
stronger big ticket comps. Hurricane-related demand for items such as power generators fueled 
+HSD big ticket comps, the first positive performance since 2Q15 (see Figures 12-13). Although 
facing  a  tougher  comparison  in  4Q,  we  expect  continued  positive  big  ticket  comps  in  4Q17, 
driven by categories such as wood-burning fire places and log splitters. Cycling through pressure 
in gun safes should also help, as should improvement in discretionary demand in energy-centric 
markets. Nonetheless, we see more limited comp and big ticket comp drivers for TSCO than for 
the  home  centers.  The  home  remodel  cycle  remains  strong,  with  solid  demand  for  growth  in 
appliances, Pro sales and remodeling projects to which TSCO has little  exposure relative to the 
home centers.

Core Pet Category Remains in Focus 

 
Pet  category  sales  outperformance  slipped  in  3Q17  as  rest  of  business  improved.  Pet  and 
Livestock  is  TSCO’s  core  category,  accounting  for  ~48%  of  sales.  Excluding  the  Petsense 
acquisition,  category  comps  increased  ~4%  in  3Q17  vs.  ~5%  in  2Q  and  flattish  in  1Q.  While 
category  growth  was  solid  in  3Q17,  we  note  that  comps  underperformed  the  reported  total 
comp of 6.6%, implying that comps excluding Pet and Livestock were ~9%, driving a wide level of 
underperformance  not  experienced  since  4Q15  (see  Figures  14  and  15).  Strong  hurricane  and 
weather-related  demand  likely  boosted  sales  performance  outside  of  the  Pet  and  Livestock 
category in 3Q17, and weather may once again lead Pet and Livestock to underperform in 4Q17. 
In the face of increasing online and mass/grocery store competition, TSCO continues to fortify its 
pet offering  with both channel-exclusive brands and proprietary brands. In 2017, in addition to 
extending  the  4health  proprietary  brand  in  the  pet  food/animal  category,  TSCO  launched  an 
exclusive brand of premium dog and cat food in Petsense stores this month called TrueSource.

Note:  Implied  category  comps  derived  from  the  category  sales  mix,  which  includes  the  Petsense  acquisition.  We  exclude 
estimated Petsense sales since acquisition in 4Q16 of ~$25m-$35m per quarter to calculate the implied comps. 

 

 

 
Pressures  on  pet  category  likely  to  grow  from  online,  mass/grocery,  with  PetSmart  recent 
results  a  sign.  While  TSCO’s  Pet  and  Livestock  category  remains  strong,  we  see  an  increasing 
threat  from  the  online  and  mass/grocery  channels,  and  given  the  traffic-driving  nature  of  this 
core  CUE  category,  TSCO  risks  losing  other  (typically  higher-margin)  discretionary  sales  that 
accrue from the traffic. According to Packaged Facts, Internet sales accounted for 9% of the $48b 
U.S.  market  for  pet  products  in  2016,  and  this  likely  increased  to  a  LDD  mix  in  2017,  led  by 
outsized growth from AMZN. Internet sales continue to outpace and cannibalize sales from other 
channels, notably pet super stores like PetSmart. Indeed, according to One Click Retail, AMZN Pet 
Products  category  sales  in  the  12  month  period  ending  September,  2017  increased  33%  y/y  to 
$2.2b;  the  Pet  Food  &  Feeding  Supplies  sub-category  sales  increased  47%  y/y  to  $970m.  Also 
notable,  PetSmart  reported  30%  y/y  revenue  growth  in  3Q17  driven  entirely  by  its  ~$3b 
acquisition of Chewy.com, but revenue in its legacy business slipped by 1.5% and legacy business 
EBITDA  declined  15%  y/y;  management  also  uncharacteristically  refrained  from  guiding  4Q 
results.  Additional challenges include pet suppliers’ decision to shift to mass distribution as seen 
by Colgate-Palmolive (Science Diet) in 4Q16 and more recently, Blue Buffalo’s decision to sell its 
premium pet food brand in the mass and grocery channel.

Footwear and apparel also on watch. In addition to pressure on the pet category, other at-risk 
categories include apparel and footwear (~7% of sales). These categories are growing fast online. 
TSCO has a wider selection of footwear and apparel online, often available direct from vendors, 
but  that  hasn’t  stopped  it  from  underperforming  some  other  categories  in  recent  quarters. 
Excluding  Petsense,  footwear  and  apparel  penetration  slipped  ~200  bps  y/y  in  1Q17  and 
remained constant y/y in 2Q17 and 3Q17. We expect better performance from this category in 
4Q17 due to weather. 
 
 
Company-Specific Initiatives on Track 

 
TSCO  completed  its  nationwide  rollouts  of  buy-online-pickup-in-store  (BOPIS)  and  Neighbor’s 
Club loyalty program at the end of 2Q17, both of which we believe should be incremental sales 
drivers and increase customer loyalty in 2018.  
 
Initial  BOPIS  results  are  encouraging.  Approximately  75%  of  online  orders  were  picked  up  at 
stores  in  3Q  (up  from  55%  in  2Q),  signaling  the  importance  of  the  bricks  and  mortar  location. 
BOPIS  average  tickets  remain  significantly  higher  than  the  company  average  and  customers 
usually buy 3.5 to 4 additional items when they come into the store to pick up an online order, 
driving sales that are ~2x the company’s average ticket size. 
 
Neighbor’s Club gaining traction. Members are receiving reward opportunities and personalized 
advertising based on transaction history, driving increases in comp transactions and basket sizes. 
As of 3Q17 end, Neighbor’s Club had over 5 million members; TSCO believes there are well over 
10m  customers  for  which  it  will  have  buying  history  for  when  the  program  fully  ramps.  Over 
time,  the  company  will  able  to  increase  further  refine  its  personalized  communications  and 
improve customer loyalty. 
  
Other  technology  initiatives  on  tap.  TSCO  is  piloting  other  technology  initiatives  including 
Mobile  POS  and  Stockyard.  Mobile  POS  allows  store  associates  to  find  information,  locate 
product and check inventory for products in surrounding stores as well as process a sale through 
a mobile device. Stockyard is a store-level initiative that merges online and in-store capabilities, 
allowing  store  team  members  and  customers  to  tap  into  a  wider  assortment  of  products  in 
vendors’  inventories.  This  extends  TSCO’s  digital  footprint  and  gives  store  associates  access  to 
merchandise that is not usually carried in stores, which is helpful for customers that are looking 
to  find  more  “long-tail,”  unique/hard-to-find  items.  Associates  can  research  the  item  on  the 
kiosk, quickly addressing customers’ needs and saving time for both themselves and consumers.    
 
Petsense  outlook  solid.  TSCO  acquired  Petsense  over  a  year  ago,  and  the  company  reported 
positive comps and +DD revenue growth in 3Q. Over the last year, TSCO has gained a stronger 
understanding  of  the  business,  determined  where  to  improve  the  model  and  integrated 
operational functions where possible. The company also launched a new Petsense e-commerce 
site late in 4Q for online purchasing and the company also plans to launch BOPIS in these stores 
in the spring of 2018.

Deflation to Ease in 2018, as Should Comp Drag from Energy Markets 

 
Deflation  has  negatively  impacted  TSCO  comps  for  roughly  four  years.  While  we  forecast  a 
continued drag from deflation this quarter (30 bps), we see potential for receding deflation and a 
possible inflection to positive in 2018 based on improving corn and Brent crude oil futures prices. 
Corn  futures  and  oil  futures  historically  correlate  with  TSCO  inflation/deflation  impacts  on  a 
three quarter lagged basis (corn 0.85; oil: 0.67) since 2009. Corn futures have remained flattish in 
recent  months,  decreasing  -0.7%  in  4Q17  (vs.  8.4%  in  3Q),  and  oil  futures  increased  a  sharp 
20.4% in 4Q17 (vs. 11.1% in 3Q).

The regional farm and energy economies tied to these commodity prices are also important to 
TSCO sales. Indeed, softer demand across oil/energy markets continues to weigh on TSCO, led by 
softer sales in product categories including welders, compressors and larger ticket items such as 
truck  boxes  and  fuel  handling  equipment.  For  the  last  several  quarters,  TSCO  has  pointed  to 
improvement  from  stores  located  in  oil/energy  markets,  but  per-store  sales  in  these  markets 
remain  far  from  prior  sales  levels.  According  to  the  Dallas  Fed  Energy  Survey,  business  activity 
(the  survey’s  broadest  measure  of  conditions)  for  oil  and  gas  firms  continued  to  expand  for  a 
seventh consecutive quarter and improved sequentially to 38.1 in 4Q17 from 27.3 in 3Q, though 
this reading is below peak 2017 levels in 1Q17.  
 
A sub-segment of the business activity index, the company outlook index, also posted a seventh 
consecutive  positive  reading  and  increased  by  a  significant  23.8  points  sequentially  to  52.0  in 
4Q17,  suggesting  increased  optimism  amongst  exploration  and  production  firms  as  well  as 
services firms. As well, an index measuring uncertainty regarding firms’ outlooks also declined to 
-5.3  from  4.9,  the  first  negative  reading  since  the  index  was  introduced  in  1Q17  indicating 
reduced uncertainty. 
 
Figure 19: Texas Oil and Gas Activity Increased Y/Y in Recent Quarters 

 

 
Note: The Dallas Fed Energy Survey is a timely assessment of energy activity among oil and gas firms. Firms 
are  asked  questions  on  whether  business  activity,  employment,  capital  expenditures  and  other  indicators 
increased, decreased or remain unchanged 
 
Each  index  is  calculated  by  subtracting  the  percentage  of  respondents  reporting  a  decrease  from  the 
percentage reporting an increase. When the share of firms reporting an increase exceeds the share reporting 
a  decrease,  the  index  will  be  greater  than  zero,  suggesting  the  indicator  has  increased  over  the  previous 
quarter.

Margin Pressures Should Ease Modestly in 2018, but May Be Initially 
Guided below Consensus  

 
We anticipate 2018 annual comp guidance to be somewhat conservative and roughly in line with 
the  initial  guidance  provided last  year  including  2-3%  comps  and  EPS  growth  in  the  +MSD-HSD 
range.  While company-specific initiatives coupled with relatively easy comparisons through the 
key spring selling season point to a favorable top-line outlook in 2018, we see modest downside 
risk to consensus margin estimates as TSCO continues to invest in technology-related, customer-
centric  initiatives  and  face  other  cost  pressures  including  wage  inflation  and  incentive 
compensation  costs,  leading  us  to  reduce  our  estimates.  Our  underlying  SG&A  margins  now 
stand  30  bps  above  consensus  and  our  operating  margins  now  stand  30  bps  below  consensus, 
leading us to reduce our underlying 2018 EPS estimate from $3.54 to $3.48.  
 

Figure 20: TSCO Beat Initial Annual EPS Guidance in 2014, Met in 2015, Missed in 2016 and Will Likely Miss in 2017; We Look 
for Initial 2018 Comp and EPS Growth Guidance About in Line with 2017 Initial Guidance 

 

 

Source: Company data, Wedbush Securities, Inc. estimates 
Note:  2018  sales  and  EPS  growth  rates  are  from  midpoint  of  current  2017  sales  ($7.17b-$7.22b)  and  EPS  ($3.25-$3.29) 
guidance.  

 

Margin pressures likely to ease only slightly in 2018 excluding tax reform reinvestment. Looking 
into 2018, we expect gross margins to be slightly down y/y due to likely increasing fuel costs and 
higher  online  sales  penetration  (that  operate  with  estimated  ~1000  bps  lower  gross  margins), 
and expectations for continued growth in the freight-intensive CUE category. We expect benefits 
from  exclusive  brands/sourcing  and  vendor  support  from  stocking  the  New  York  DC  based  on 
past  precedence  (~15  bps  benefit  from  vendors  following  Arizona  DC  opening  noted  in  1Q16) 
with partial offsets from mix of sales. We expect SG&A deleverage to continue in 2018 due to a 
number  of  factors  higher  incentive  compensation  and  higher  pre-opening  and  other  related 
expenses associated with the new New York DC that will be fully built in 3Q18 and begin servicing 
stores  in  late  4Q18.  On  its  last  earnings  call,  TSCO  provided  some  initial  2018  assumptions 
including  expectations  for  higher  incentive  compensation  to  impact  2018  EPS  by  $0.06-$0.08 
(~25-30  bps)  and  incremental  pre-opening  and  other  expenses  associated  with  the  new  DC  to 
impact  EPS  by  ~$0.03-$0.04  (~10-15  bps)  with  most  of  the  impact  coming  in  2H18.  We  also 
anticipate continued impact from higher wage inflation across stores and DCs in 2018, but expect 
the headwind to moderate from levels experienced in 2017. We walk through our assumptions 
and detailed line-by-line estimates in our margin bridge below (see Figures 21-22).

Tax Reform Benefits Likely Partially Reinvested 

Assuming a 23% tax rate going forward (down from 36.5% in 2017E), EPS will rise ~20% all else equal, to $4.18. However, we anticipate that at 
least 15% of tax expense savings will be reinvested back into the business given even more significant reinvestment plans by home improvement 
peers such as HD and FND. Accordingly, our new 2018 EPS estimate is $4.08 (see Figure 1 and Figures 21-23 for more detail).

Valuation Fair 

On consensus  estimates,  TSCO trades above its 10-year NTM historical averages on P/E, EV/EBITDA 
and  PEG  below  its  historical  average  on  NTM  P/E  relative  to  the  S&P  500.  On  our  2018  estimates 
embedding tax reform, which bumps our underlying EPS forecast of $3.48 to $4.08, TSCO is trading 
below historical averages on P/E, relative P/E, but above historical averages on EV/EBITDA and well 
above historical averages on PEG. Moreover, PEG currently embeds a 11.3% underlying EPS growth, 
which  is  optimistic  excluding  tax  reform  benefits.  Underlying  EPS  may  grow  less  than  10%  for  the 
third straight year in 2018, and the long-term growth algorithm is no higher than low double digits. 
Due to a lower underlying EPS growth algorithm, we see limited room for further valuation multiple 
expansion.

Appendix 2. TSCO Weather “Playbook” 
 
Figure 30:  TSCO Weather Playbook 

 

Fall/Winter: 

o  Positive:  Extreme cold and winter storms; early cold winter weather trends set tone for season 
and  entice  consumers  to  buy  winter  weather  products.  This  scenario  drives  fuel,  heating  and 
outdoor power equipment sales. 

 

Example: Consumers remembering arctic weather temperatures in winter 2013 bought 
fall/winter  weather  products  as  early  as  September  in  preparation  for  the  upcoming 
2014  winter  season;  stronger  sales  in  fuel,  wood  pellets,  log  splitters,  fireplaces,  snow 
blowers and winter apparel 

o  Negative:  Warm temperatures in September and an overall mild winter may result in lackluster 

winter seasonal demand 

 

 

Example:  Cool weather came early in fall 2011 which was more favorable, but was more 
than  overshadowed  by  record  warm  weather  across  Northern  regions  through  the 
winter season. 
Example:  Similar  warm  weather  trends  occurred  in  winter  2015-2016;  while  January 
provided minor bursts of cold weather, majority of the winter season was significantly 
warmer y/y and drove sluggish seasonal demand 

 

Spring/Summer: 

o  Positive:  Early  breaking  warm  spring  weather  in  March  drives  sales  in  garden  (e.g.,  soils, 
fertilizers) and outdoor power equipment (e.g., riding lawn mowers). Ground moisture and mild 
temperatures can extend summer selling season. 

 

 

Example:  Weather  was  relatively  warmer  in  winter  2012,  so  early  transition  to  spring 
was  easier;  resulted  in  pull-forward  of  sales  to  1Q  (from  2Q).  Note  the  same  also 
happened in 2016. 
Example:  Similar  warm  weather  trends  occurred  in  winter  2015-2016;  while  January 
provided minor bursts of cold weather, majority of the winter season was significantly 
warmer y/y and drove sluggish seasonal demand 

o  Negative: An extended winter selling season is unfavorable for lawn & garden category sales as 
well as riding lawnmowers and other outdoor power equipment; dry drought-like conditions are 
also unfavorable. 

 

 

Example:  Drought-like  conditions  across  many  regions  persisted  into  the  summer  and 
drove sales weakness in 2Q12-3Q12. 
Example:    Unseasonably  cold  and  snowy  weather  in  March  2017  across  weather-
sensitive  regions  diminished  demand  for  spring  seasonal  products,  driving  weak  1Q17 
comps.

Risks to the attainment of our price target and rating include increasing competition, fluctuating industry sales and farmer income
reports, stronger macro factors, store growth plans, future promotional cadence and discounting, investments impacting SG&A, volatile
