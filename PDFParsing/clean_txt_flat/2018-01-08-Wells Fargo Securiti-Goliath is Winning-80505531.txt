one question much fintech player deposit today
histor
nobodi know ive seen numer attempt part problem
regul fintech group dont get accur data
like deal china believ chines financi dont
dont think peopl regard fintech deposit fintech
group like chines dont know wish answer
would way limb one dont know
someon talk lot banker recent said think interest
margin fall get two rate hike reconcil thought
low deposit beta peopl view call net interest
margin fall get two hike mayb dont want reconcil
histor number wrong past tri
project net interest margin basi point
goliath win
today that basi point higher economi
realli crank along good pace that effect percent better
today think net interest margin question banker
gotten use deal loss deal account
chang come loss
think greater loss control forc examin
doesnt make differ size could small
commun bank larg bank that key element take look net
interest margin side net interest margin interest incom
loan price one thing seen three
big guy realli start streamlin lend process mean
cut expens actual expens lend function
definit seen go trickl effect whole
bank side also affect thrift credit union greater
effici actual cost make loan
put togeth banker realli done theyv kind
led say im go get realli good control loan loss
second go make lend function much effici

close comment main takeaway
mike moeb moeb servic said deposit beta pretti
much half bank tell us percent versu percent
mention relationship price lower fee keep custom around
longer cure mmda tax chang could help deposit growth
that even worth risk say trio credit union commun
bank fintech firm
someth watch said lose one basi point market share
bank react lose basi point sound like all-out
caveat still seem pretti sanguin deposit rate go
much higher would reinforc add conclus would like us
take away call
think summar well dont think go see jami
dimon say launch whole convers good
dont see go high beta
reason said
final thing wouldnt dismiss think import
small busi investor want abil move money better
mean
reserv save account saw take would see money
come rate wouldnt matter much fact oh im limit
